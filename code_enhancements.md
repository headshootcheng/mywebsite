## Files Modified

### Core Components
1. `pages/index.tsx` - Enhanced with performance optimizations
2. `components/HomePage/*/index.tsx` - All homepage components updated
3. `components/NavBar/index.tsx` - Improved navigation with accessibility
4. `hooks/useMobile.ts` - Enhanced with proper cleanup

### Configuration Files
1. `.eslintrc.js` - Updated with React version and improved rules
2. `tsconfig.json` - Enhanced TypeScript configuration
3. `next.config.js` - Added performance optimizations
4. `tailwind.config.js` - Enhanced with custom utilities

### New Files Created
1. `hooks/useIntersectionObserver.ts` - Reusable intersection observer hook
2. `hooks/useScrollThrottle.ts` - Throttled scroll event handling
3. `utils/accessibility.ts` - Accessibility utility functions
4. `utils/performance.ts` - Performance monitoring utilities

## Performance Improvements

### Before
- Multiple scroll event listeners
- Unoptimized re-renders
- No lazy loading for images
- Basic accessibility support

### After
- Single optimized scroll handler using Intersection Observer
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
